o Introduction:

  bims is designed and implemented as an analogy of Going input kernel
  of Window platform.

  The kernel could be used in various applications, not limited to
  Phonetic input method. However, because of the limited accuracy it
  can achieve so far, no other applications are under consideration.

  It makes use of libtabe, and is independent of user-interface. In
  the directory examples/GTK, you can find a file `gtk_entryglue.c',
  which glue the input method logic directly to GTK Entry widget.

  It is also being used by Xcin as it's default Phonetic input method.

o Supported Key Maps:

  Four Key Maps are currently supported.

  1. Zozy Key Map
  2. Eten Key Map
  3. Hsu Key Map
  4. ET26 Key Map

  The implement of Hsu Key Map and ET26 Key Map may be wrong, though.
