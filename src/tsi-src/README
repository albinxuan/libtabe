1. Introduction

  tsi.src contains 138614 chinese lexicons in Big5 encoding
compiled from 3 sources. They are

  (1) Chih-Hao Tsai

      http://casper.beckman.uiuc.edu/~c-tsai4/chinese/wordlists.html

  (2) IOME

  (3) Xcin

  Lexicons from these sources are then be merged and slightly
modified.

  Each line in tsi.src represents describe a lexicon. Each line
consists of two to three fields, they are

  (1) the lexicon itself

  (2) the reference count summarized by the
      Computer Systems and Communication Lab,
      Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica

  (3) the pronunciation in BoPoMoFo which was summarized
      from various sources and majorly edited manually

the pronunciation in BoPoMoFo may not be present, and each field is
separated by space character(' ').

2. The lexicon

  Despite of the first source listed in the first section, I can hardly
find obvious reference point for the second and the third sources. 

  The first source contributes over 95% lexicons to the collecton.

3. The reference count

  The reference count is important for some applications, but there
does not exist freely accessible corpus for generating the referece
count. I asked CCL, IIS, Academia Sinica, where I was working for,
for the permission to gather information from a corpus consists of
HTML pages gathered from the Internet sites in Taiwan and granted.

  I sampled 1,200,000 pages from the database (which contains more
than 2,000,000 pages at that time) at the beginning of March, 1999.
The pages are gathered in December, 1998.

  Maximum Matching Segmentation Algorithm is the method I used to
identify lexicons present in each HTML page. You can read

  http://casper.beckman.uiuc.edu/~c-tsai4/chinese/wordseg/mmseg.html

for more information about the algorithm.

  Some lexicons have 0 reference count.

4. The pronunciation

  Pronunciation is also important for some applications, so I started
to collect available data from the Internet as well as asked friends
to edit the data.

  Some of the pronunciation data are not correct and some of them are
not present.
