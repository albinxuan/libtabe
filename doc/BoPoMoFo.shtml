<P>
<I>BoPoMoFo</I>, similar to PinYin or other Romanization system used
elsewhere, is the most common method for learning Mandarin/Chinese
pronunciation in Taiwan area.  The system consists of 37 phonetic
plus 5 tone symbols.  Each basic pronunciation of Chinese is made up
of at most 3 phonetic symbols and exactly one tone symbol.  Each of
the 37 phonetic symbol can appear once in a pronunciation, and not all
the combinations of phonetic symbols are meaningful.  The 37 phonetic
symbols are exclusively divided into 3 groups, only one symbols out
of a group can be used to make up pronunciation.  The 3 phonetic
symbols used to make up a pronunciation come out of the 3 groups, one
for each group.
</P>

<H2><A NAME="encoding">Encoding System</A></H2>
<P>
Each of the 37 phonetic symbols are assigned number for 1 to 37. The 5
tone symbols are assigned number from 38 to 42. `0' is used to
designate there's no symbol in the position.  The word `electricity''s
pronunciation code thus is (5, 22, 33, 41).
</P>

<P>
To help processing of the code, we designed an encoding system that
uses 15bit, i.e., less than 2 bytes to represent it.  The reason is
try to maintain all the combinations while be space-efficient.  The
first group have phonetic symbols has 21 symbols, the second group has
3, the third group has 13, as shown in Table 1.  So we use 6 bits for
the first group, 2 bits for the second group and 4 bits for the third
group, plus 3 bits for the tone symbols.

<P>
The symbol value stored is the offset in it's group plus 1. (0 is
reserved)  So the encoding for the example code in the previous
paragraph is
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"0 000101<TT>(5)</TT> 01<TT>(22-21=1)</TT>
1001<TT>(33-24=9)</TT> 100<TT>(41-37=4)</TT>"
</BLOCKQUOTE>
It's 2764 in decimal. All the pronunciation related functions used the
encoding as internal pronunciation representations and storage format.

<P>
The encoding system was inspired by the ETen Chinese System's hashing
function, and brought to attention by Yung-Ching Hsiao.
